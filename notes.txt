Trying to figure out how to run all the Stan tests on the cluster.
Two different tests:
1. current state of develop.
2. merge a pull request, specified by a commit hash.

Steps that need to be taken:
1. Update repository. If it's a pull request, merge pull request.
2. Build bin/libstanc.a, bin/libstan.a
3. Generate all test files. These are generated by building
   src/test/unit-distribution/*_00000_generated_test.cpp
4. For each file, run the test and output results.
5. Collect all output, package, and send back.


Steps 1,2,3 could be one job.
Step 4 could be many jobs, or one job that requires many cores?
Step 5, should be run last and should indicate success or failure.
